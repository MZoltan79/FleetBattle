# FleetBattle

This is our homework project for the summer.

The goal was to make a battleships game, which can be played in singleplayer or multiplayer mode as well.

Unfortunately my teammates couldn't help as much as we wanted, so i made everything...

The project is closed at the moment. Maybe some day I'll improve it.
